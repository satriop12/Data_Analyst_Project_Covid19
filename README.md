Gaining Insights about the Spread and Risks of COVID-19. Preparing, Processing, and Analyzing Datasets using SQL in Google BigQuery, followed by Visualization with Tableau. This project aims to find out about COVID-19 infection and subsequently execute a mass vaccination initiative in regions with the highest transmission rates

Workflow

1. Retrieve the dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
2. Import the datasets into Google BigQuery.
3. Extract the data through querying to obtain the table.
4. Download the resulting table.
5. Import the table into Tableau for Data Visualization.
6. Create a Dashboard using Tableau.


Points of Interest
1. COVID-19 Spread up to 21 August 2023
2. Quantifying COVID-19 Fatality Rates
3. Estimating the Number of Infected Individuals in Each Country

SQL work

Querying data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths to find out:
1. Global Number of Covid Case and Deaths
2. Continent and Country with the highest death count
3. Country with the highest infection rate
4. Total case of the country and the population
5. Total case and death per country
6. Total population of the country and how the vaccination is going
7. Percentage of People arroung the world that got infected
8. Percentage of People Arround the world that got vaccinated

Tableau work
1. Visualizing Covid-19 cases and deaths up 21 August 2023 (using table)
2. Visualizing COVID-19 Fatality Rates (using bar chart)
3. Visualizing Infected Individuals in Each Country (using map chart)


Insights

1. Despite the fatality rate not exceeding 1%, the loss of nearly 7 million lives due to this virus warrants further attention. For instance, a comprehensive global vaccine distribution is imperative.
2. The European continent holds the highest mortality rates. Map visualizations indicate that several European countries exhibit significant infection transmission percentages.
3. Advanced data regarding vaccine distribution is essential.
